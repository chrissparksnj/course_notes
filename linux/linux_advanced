Linux Kernel

Applications <--> Library Functions <--> Kernel

Commands for hardware info:
	- lshw  (hardware info)
	- lspci (pci are devices plugged into motherboard: audio device, harddrive, NIC)
	- lsusb (usb devices)
	- lsbk  (block devices)
	- lscpu (cpu info)
	- lsdev (device files)
	
Controlling Hardware
	- hdparm 
	- proc, dev, sys files allow to write to kernel
	- inb, outb (controlls input output)
	- setpci (config pci devices)

# lspci -v (verbose) (kernel driver in use)
# lsusb
# lscpu (bogoMIPS: speed of processer. larger the better)

System Calls: 
	- Functions implemented by the kernel and meant to be called from user space
	- Application interface to the kernel
	- about 300 system calls
	- include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h
	- man section 2 (system call information)
