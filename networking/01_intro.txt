Simple Protocol

1. Client PC requests a TCP connection to web server
2. Web server replies that it's ok to connect
3. Client PC requests a document
4. Server responds and sends document

* a protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged 
* between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions
* taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

Access networks: edge routers that connect you to internet

Two most common ways to connect to internet:
	- Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
	- Cable

DSL uses telephone (twisted pair copper wire) to exchange digital data
DSL modem translates digital data to high frequency tones
Telephone line carries data and traditional signals.

Cable internet connection
	- every packet sent by cable co (downstream) goes to every home.
	- home packets (upstream) travels on upstream channel to head.

LAN: used to connect end systems to edge routers

Physical Media: Ways to transmit packets
	- guided media: a solid medium like copper wire
	- unguided media: wireless LAN or digital satellite

Twister Pair:	
	- UTP: Unshielded twister pair
	- twisted pair (6a) can support 10Gbps

Coaxial Cable:
	- shared medium: many processes can run over this medium

Fiber Optics
	- 100Gbs
	- expensive equiptment: transmitters, receivers, and switches

Terrestrial Radio Channels
	- attractive because they can run through walls
	- provide connectivity to mobile users
	- three categories: short distance, local areas, wide areas
	- Short: wireless mouse
	- Local: Wireless LAN
	- Wide: Cellular network

Satellite Radio
	- Geostationary and LEO
	- Geostationary: Fixed position at 36,000 km above earth's surface
	- Low Earth Orbitting: Rotate around earth, provide internet to no connection areas.
